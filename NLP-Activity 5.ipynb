As its author told investigators , the Phoenix memo was not an alert about suicide\n","[1006] pilots .\n","[1007] His worry was more about a Pan Am Flight 103 scenario in which explosives\n","[1008] were placed on an aircraft .\n","[1009] The memo 's references to aviation training were broad,\n","[1010] including aeronautical engineering .\n","[1011] If the memo had been distributed in a timely fashion and its recommendations acted on\n","[1012] promptly , we do not believe it would have uncovered the plot .\n","[1013] It might well,\n","[1014] however , have sensitized the FBI so that it might have taken the Moussaoui matter\n","[1015] more seriously the next month .\n","[1016] Zacarias Moussaoui\n","[1017] On August 15, 2001 , the Minneapolis FBI Field Office initiated an intelligence\n","[1018] investigation on Zacarias Moussaoui .\n","[1019] As mentioned in chapter 7 , he had entered the\n","[1020] United States in February 2001 , and had begun flight lessons at Airman Flight School\n","[1021] in Norman , Oklahoma .\n","[1022] He resumed his training at the Pan Am International Flight\n","[1023] Academy in Eagan , Minnesota , starting on August 13 .\n","[1024] He had none of the usual\n","[1025] qualifications for flight training on Pan Am 's Boeing 747 flight simulators .\n","[1026] He said\n","[1027] he did not intend to become a commercial pilot but wanted the training as an `` ego\n","[1028] boosting thing . ''\n","[1029] Moussaoui stood out because , with little knowledge of flying , he\n","[1030] wanted to learn how to `` take off and land '' a Boeing 747 .\n","[1031] The agent in Minneapolis quickly learned that Moussaoui possessed jihadist beliefs .\n","[1032] Moreover , Moussaoui had $32,000 in a bank account but did not provide a plausible\n","[1033] explanation for this sum of money .\n","[1034] He had traveled to Pakistan but became agitated\n","[1035] when asked if he had traveled to nearby countries while in Pakistan ( Pakistan was\n","[1036] the customary route to the training camps in Afghanistan ) .\n","[1037] He planned to receive\n","[1038] martial arts training , and intended to purchase a global positioning receiver .\n","[1039] The\n","[1040] agent also noted that Moussaoui became extremely agitated whenever he was questioned\n","[1041] regarding his religious beliefs .\n","[1042] The agent concluded that Moussaoui was `` an Islamic\n","[1043] extremist preparing for some future act in furtherance of radical fundamentalist\n","[1044] goals . ''\n","[1045] He also believed Moussaoui 's plan was related to his flight training .\n","[1046] Moussaoui can be seen as an al Qaeda mistake and a missed opportunity .\n","[1047] An apparently\n","[1048] unreliable operative , he had fallen into the hands of the FBI .\n","[1049] As discussed in\n","[1050] chapter 7 , Moussaoui had been in contact with and received money from Ramzi\n","[1051] Binalshibh .\n","[1052] If Moussaoui had been connected to al Qaeda , questions should instantly\n","[1053] have arisen about a possible al Qaeda plot that involved piloting airliners , a\n","[1054] possibility that had never been seriously analyzed by the intelligence community .\n","[1055] The FBI agent who handled the case in conjunction with the INS representative on the\n","[1056] Minneapolis Joint Terrorism Task Force suspected that Moussaoui might be planning to\n","[1057] hijack a plane .\n","[1058] Minneapolis and FBI headquarters debated whether Moussaoui should be\n","[1059] arrested immediately or surveilled to obtain additional information .\n","[1060] Because it was\n","[1061] not clear whether Moussaoui could be imprisoned , the FBI case agent decided the most\n","[1062] important thing was to prevent Moussaoui from obtaining any further training that he\n","[1063] could use to carry out a potential attack .\n","[1064] As a French national who had overstayed his visa , Moussaoui could be detained\n","[1065] immediately .\n","[1066] The INS arrested Moussaoui on the immigration violation .\n","[1067] A deportation\n","[1068] order was signed on August 17, 2001 .\n","[1069] The agents in Minnesota were concerned that the U.S. Attorney's Office in Minneapolis\n","[1070] would find insufficient probable cause of a crime to obtain a criminal warrant to\n","[1071] search Moussaoui 's laptop computer .\n","[1072] Agents at FBI headquarters believed there was insufficient probable cause .\n","[1073] Minneapolis therefore sought a special warrant under the Foreign Intelligence\n","[1074] Surveillance Act to conduct the search ( we introduced FISA in chapter 3 ) .\n","[1075] To do so , however , the FBI needed to demonstrate probable cause that Moussaoui was an\n","[1076] agent of a foreign power , a demonstration that was not required to obtain a criminal\n","[1077] warrant but was a statutory requirement for a FISA warrant .\n","[1078] The case agent did not have sufficient information to connect Moussaoui to a `` foreign\n","[1079] power , '' so he reached out for help , in the United States and overseas .\n","[1080] The FBI agent 's August 18 message requested assistance from the FBI legal attach� in\n","[1081] Paris .\n","[1082] Moussaoui had lived in London , so the Minneapolis agent sought assistance\n","[1083] from the legal attach� there as well .\n","[1084] By August 24 , the Minneapolis agent had also\n","[1085] contacted an FBI detailee and a CIA desk officer at the Counterterrorist Center\n","[1086] about the case .\n","[1087] The FBI legal attach� 's office in Paris first contacted the French government on\n","[1088] August 16 or 17 , shortly after speaking to the Minneapolis case agent on the\n","[1089] telephone .\n","[1090] On August 22 and 27 , the French provided information that made a\n","[1091] connection between Moussaoui and a rebel leader in Chechnya , Ibn al Khattab .\n","[1092] This\n","[1093] set off a spirited debate between the Minneapolis Field Office , FBI headquarters,\n","[1094] and the CIA as to whether the Chechen rebels and Khattab were sufficiently\n","[1095] associated with a terrorist organization to constitute a `` foreign power '' for\n","[1096] purposes of the FISA statute .\n","[1097] FBI headquarters did not believe this was good enough,\n","[1098] and its National Security Law Unit declined to submit a FISA application .\n","[1099] After receiving the written request for assistance , the legal attach� in London had\n","[1100] promptly forwarded it to his counterparts in the British government , hand-delivering\n","[1101] the request on August 21 .\n","[1102] On August 24 , the CIA also sent a cable to London and\n","[1103] Paris regarding `` subjects involved in suspicious 747 flight training '' that described\n","[1104] Moussaoui as a possible `` suicide hijacker . ''\n","[1105] On August 28 , the CIA sent a request for\n","[1106] information to a different service of the British government ; this communication\n","[1107] warned that Moussaoui might be expelled to Britain by the end of August .\n","[1108] The FBI\n","[1109] office in London raised the matter briefly with British officials as an aside , after\n","[1110] a meeting about a more urgent matter on September 3 , and sent the British service a\n","[1111] written update on September 5 .\n","[1112] The case was not handled by the British as a priority\n","[1113] amid a large number of other terrorist-related inquiries .\n","[1114] On September 4 , the FBI sent a teletype to the CIA , the FAA , the Customs Service , the\n","[1115] State Department , the INS , and the Secret Service summarizing the known facts\n","[1116] regarding Moussaoui .\n","[1117] It did not report the case agent 's personal assessment that\n","[1118] Moussaoui planned to hijack an airplane .\n","[1119] It did contain the FAA 's comment that it\n","[1120] was not unusual for Middle Easterners to attend flight training schools in the\n","[1121] United States .\n","[1122] Although the Minneapolis agents wanted to tell the FAA from the beginning about\n","[1123] Moussaoui , FBI headquarters instructed Minneapolis that it could not share the more\n","[1124] complete report the case agent had prepared for the FAA .\n","[1125] The Minneapolis supervisor\n","[1126] sent the case agent in person to the local FAA office to fill in what he thought\n","[1127] were gaps in the FBI headquarters teletype .\n","[1128] No FAA actions seem to have been taken in response .\n","[1129] There was substantial disagreement between Minneapolis agents and FBI headquarters as\n","[1130] to what Moussaoui was planning to do .\n","[1131] In one conversation between a Minneapolis\n","[1132] supervisor and a headquarters agent , the latter complained that Minneapolis 's FISA\n","[1133] request was couched in a manner intended to get people `` spun up . ''\n","[1134] The supervisor\n","[1135] replied that was precisely his intent .\n","[1136] He said he was `` trying to keep someone from\n","[1137] taking a plane and crashing into the World Trade Center . ''\n","[1138] The headquarters agent\n","[1139] replied that this was not going to happen and that they did not know if Moussaoui\n","[1140] was a terrorist .\n","[1141] There is no evidence that either FBI Acting Director Pickard or Assistant Director\n","[1142] for Counterterrorism Dale Watson was briefed on the Moussaoui case prior to 9/11 .\n","[1143] Michael Rolince , the FBI assistant director heading the Bureau 's\n","[1144] InternationalTerrorism Operations Section ( ITOS ) , recalled being told about\n","[1145] Moussaoui in two passing hallway conversations but only in the context that he might\n","[1146] be receiving telephone calls from Minneapolis complaining about how headquarters was\n","[1147] handling the matter .\n","[1148] He never received such a call .\n","[1149] Although the acting special\n","[1150] agent in charge of Minneapolis called the ITOS supervisors to discuss the Moussaoui\n","[1151] case on August 27 , he declined to go up the chain of command at FBI headquarters and\n","[1152] call Rolince .\n","[1153] On August 23 , DCI Tenet was briefed about the Moussaoui case in a briefing titled\n","[1154] '' Islamic Extremist Learns to Fly . ''\n","[1155] Tenet was also told\n","[1156] that Moussaoui wanted to learn to fly a 747 , paid for his training in cash , was\n","[1157] interested to learn the doors do not open in flight , and wanted to fly a simulated\n","[1158] flight from London to New York .\n","[1159] He was told that the FBI had arrested Moussaoui\n","[1160] because of a visa overstay and that the CIA was working the case with the FBI .\n","[1161] Tenet\n","[1162] told us that no connection to al Qaeda was apparent to him at the time .\n","[1163] Seeing it as\n","[1164] an FBI case , he did not discuss the matter with anyone at the White House or the\n","[1165] FBI .\n","[1166] No connection was made between Moussaoui 's presence in the United States and\n","[1167] the threat reporting during the summer of 2001 .\n","[1168] On September 11 , after the attacks , the FBI office in London renewed their appeal for\n","[1169] information about Moussaoui .\n","[1170] In response to U.S. requests , the British government\n","[1171] supplied some basic biographical information about Moussaoui .\n","[1172] The British government\n","[1173] informed us that it also immediately tasked intelligence collection facilities for\n","[1174] information about Moussaoui .\n","[1175] On September 13 , the British government received new,\n","[1176] sensitive intelligence that Moussaoui had attended an al Qaeda training camp in\n","[1177] Afghanistan .\n","[1178] It passed this intelligence to the United States on the same day .\n","[1179] Had\n","[1180] this information been available in late August 2001 , the Moussaoui case would almost\n","[1181] certainly have received intense , high-level attention .\n","[1182] The FBI also learned after 9/11 that the millennium terrorist Ressam , who by 2001 was\n","[1183] cooperating with investigators , recognized Moussaoui as someone who had been in the\n","[1184] Afghan camps .\n","[1185] As mentioned above , before 9/11 the FBI agents in Minneapolis had failed to persuade\n","[1186] supervisors at headquarters that there was enough evidence to seek a FISA warrant to\n","[1187] search Moussaoui 's computer hard drive and belongings .\n","[1188] Either the British\n","[1189] information or the Ressam identification would have broken the logjam .\n","[1190] A maximum U.S. effort to investigate Moussaoui conceivably could have unearthed his\n","[1191] connections to Binalshibh .\n","[1192] Those connections might have brought investigators to the\n","[1193] core of the 9/11 plot .\n","[1194] The Binalshibh connection was recognized shortly after 9/11,\n","[1195] though it was not an easy trail to find .\n","[1196] Discovering it would have required quick\n","[1197] and very substantial cooperation from the German government , which might well have\n","[1198] been difficult to obtain .\n","[1199] However , publicity about Moussaoui 's arrest and a possible\n","[1200] hijacking threat might have derailed the plot.107With time , the search for Mihdhar\n","[1201] and Hazmi and the investigation of Moussaoui might also have led to a breakthrough\n","[1202] that would have disrupted the plot .\n","[1203] Khalid Sheikh Mohammed\n","[1204] Another late opportunity was presented by a confluence of information regarding\n","[1205] Khalid Sheikh Mohammed received by the intelligence community in the summer of 2001 .\n","[1206] The possible links between KSM , Moussaoui , and an individual only later identified\n","[1207] as Ramzi Binalshibh would remain undiscovered , however .\n","[1208] Although we readily equate KSM with al Qaeda today , this was not the case before\n","[1209] 9/11 .\n","[1210] KSM , who had been indicted in January 1996 for his role in the Manila air\n","[1211] plot , was seen primarily as another freelance terrorist , associated with Ramzi\n","[1212] Yousef .\n","[1213] Because the links between KSM and Bin Ladin or al Qaeda were not recognized\n","[1214] at the time , responsibility for KSM remained in the small Islamic Extremist Branch\n","[1215] of the Counterterrorist Center , not in the Bin Ladin unit .\n","[1216] Moreover , because KSM had already been indicted , he became targeted for arrest .\n","[1217] In\n","[1218] 1997 , the Counterterrorist Center added a Renditions Branch to help find wanted\n","[1219] fugitives .\n","[1220] Responsibility for KSM was transferred to this branch , which gave the CIA\n","[1221] a `` man-to-man '' focus but was not an analytical unit .\n","[1222] When subsequent information\n","[1223] came , more critical for analysis than for tracking , no unit had the job of following\n","[1224] up on what the information might mean .\n","[1225] For example , in September 2000 , a source had reported that an individual named Khalid\n","[1226] al-Shaykh al-Ballushi was a key lieutenant in al Qaeda .\n","[1227] Al- Ballushi means `` from\n","[1228] Baluchistan , '' and KSM is from Baluchistan .\n","[1229] Recognizing the possible significance of\n","[1230] this information , the Bin Ladin unit sought more information .\n","[1231] When no information\n","[1232] was forthcoming , the Bin Ladin unit dropped the matter .\n","[1233] When additional pieces of the puzzle arrived in the spring and summer of 2001 , they\n","[1234] were not put together .\n","[1235] The first piece of the puzzle concerned some intriguing information associated with a\n","[1236] person known as `` Mukhtar '' that the CIA had begun analyzing in April 2001 .\n","[1237] The CIA\n","[1238] did not know who Mukhtar was at the time-only that he associated with al Qaeda\n","[1239] lieutenant Abu Zubaydah and that , based on the nature of the information , he was\n","[1240] evidently involved in planning possible terrorist activities .\n","[1241] The second piece of the puzzle was some alarming information regarding KSM .\n","[1242] On June\n","[1243] 12, 2001 , a CIA report said that `` Khaled '' was actively recruiting people to travel\n","[1244] outside Afghanistan , including to the United States where colleagues were reportedly\n","[1245] already in the country to meet them , to carry out terrorist-related activities for\n","[1246] Bin Ladin .\n","[1247] CIA headquarters presumed from the details of the reporting that this\n","[1248] person was Khalid Sheikh Mohammed .\n","[1249] In July , the same source was shown a series of\n","[1250] photographs and identified a photograph of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed as the Khaled he\n","[1251] had previously discussed .\n","[1252] The final piece of the puzzle arrived at the CIA 's Bin Ladin unit on August 28 in a\n","[1253] cable reporting that KSM 's nickname was Mukhtar .\n","[1254] No one made the connection to the\n","[1255] reports about Mukhtar that had been circulated in the spring .\n","[1256] This connection might\n","[1257] also have underscored concern about the June reporting that KSM was recruiting\n","[1258] terrorists to travel , including to the United States .\n","[1259] Only after 9/11 would it be\n","[1260] discovered that Muhktar/KSM had communicated with a phone that was used by\n","[1261] Binalshibh , and that Binalshibh had used the same phone to communicate with\n","[1262] Moussaoui , as discussed in chapter 7 .\n","[1263] As in the Moussaoui situation already\n","[1264] described , the links to Binalshibh might not have been an easy trail to find and\n","[1265] would have required substantial cooperation from the German government .\n","[1266] But time was\n","[1267] short , and running out .\n","[1268] Time Runs Out\n","[1269] As Tenet told us , `` the system was blinking red '' during the summer of 2001 .\n","[1270] Officials\n","[1271] were alerted across the world .\n","[1272] Many were doing everything they possibly could to\n","[1273] respond to the threats .\n","[1274] Yet no one working on these late leads in the summer of 2001 connected the case in\n","[1275] his or her in-box to the threat reports agitating senior officials and being briefed\n","[1276] to the President .\n","[1277] Thus , these individual cases did not become national priorities .\n","[1278] As the CIA supervisor `` John\" told us , no one looked at the bigger picture ; no\n","[1279] analytic work foresaw the lightning that could connect the thundercloud to the\n","[1280] ground .\n","[1281] We see little evidence that the progress of the plot was disturbed by any government\n","[1282] action .\n","[1283] The U.S. government was unable to capitalize on mistakes made by al Qaeda .\n","[1284]
